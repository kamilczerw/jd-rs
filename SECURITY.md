# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest commit on the `main` branch. Once official releases begin, the most recent stable release will receive patches as needed.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities privately to the maintainers using GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability). Do **not** open a public issue.

When filing a report, include:

- A description of the issue and the impact.
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept code.
- Any known mitigations.

We aim to acknowledge reports within **three business days** and will keep you informed as the investigation progresses. Once a fix is available, we will coordinate public disclosure alongside the patch release.

If you have questions about this policy, open a discussion or reach out via the private reporting channel above.
