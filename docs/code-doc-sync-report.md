# Code vs Documentation Synchronization Report

## Summary
- Reviewed the architecture notes, final report, status artifacts, release notes, benchmarks, and implementation plan under `docs/`.
- Compared the documented feature claims against the current Rust workspace, focusing on the CLI (`crates/jd-cli`), test suite layout, and supporting crates.
- Identified several documentation statements that no longer match the implemented functionality and recorded recommended follow-ups.

## Detailed Findings
| Documentation | Stated Behavior | Observed Implementation | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Release notes draft asserts full parity with Go `jd`, including patch and translate modes, and parity across merge/set configurations.【F:docs/release-notes/v0.1.0.md†L3-L10】 | The CLI still returns explicit `not implemented` errors for patch/translate execution and set/mset/setkeys metadata flags.【F:crates/jd-cli/src/main.rs†L136-L167】 | Users following the release notes will expect working patch/translate/set parity and be surprised by immediate failures. |
| Final report overview states the workspace "mirrors the Go `jd` CLI" alongside diff, patch, renderers, fuzzing, and benchmarks.【F:docs/final-report.md†L3-L14】 | Only diff mode is wired into the CLI; patch/translate remain stubs while other components (fuzzing, benches) are present.【F:crates/jd-cli/src/main.rs†L136-L148】 | Stakeholders reading the final report will assume CLI parity is complete even though milestone work remains outstanding. |
| Architecture doc describes `tests/` as housing CLI integration tests with Go-generated golden fixtures.【F:docs/architecture.md†L7-L12】【F:docs/architecture.md†L41-L46】 | The only entry under `tests/` is a README example smoke test; no CLI integration or golden fixtures are present.【F:tests/readme_examples.rs†L1-L14】 | Contributors relying on the architecture notes will look for non-existent fixtures/tests, slowing onboarding and parity validation. |

## Recommendations
1. Treat the final report and release notes as a feature contract and finish wiring up patch/translate/set support in the CLI so the published claims become accurate.
2. Build out the documented CLI integration tests and golden fixtures under `tests/` to satisfy the architecture commitments rather than scaling the docs back.
3. As new functionality lands, validate that the docs still match the shipped behavior as part of the delivery checklist so regressions are caught immediately.
