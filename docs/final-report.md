# Final Report — Rust Port of `jd`

## Overview
- Delivered a workspace that mirrors the Go `jd` CLI and libraries, including diff, patch, renderers, fuzzing targets, and Criterion benchmarks.
- Regenerated golden fixtures and updated the Go fixture generator to snapshot diffs before invoking renderers so the captured additions remain in original order while still exercising the Go patch renderer.【b6fb49†L1-L61】

## Key Decisions
- [ADR 0001](../ADRs/0001-clarify-test-flag.md) records the decision to keep the Go CLI flag set intact, including the legacy `-v2` shim, to guarantee familiar ergonomics.
- [ADR 0002](../ADRs/0002-adopt-arbitrary-for-fuzzing.md) documents adopting `arbitrary` to feed the fuzz harnesses so structured inputs can stress the diff/patch invariants effectively.
- [ADR 0003](../ADRs/0003-clarify-color-handling.md) locks the color-handling behavior to the explicit `-color` flag, matching upstream expectations for TTY detection.

## Validation & Parity
- `cargo test --all-features` passes across unit, integration, property, fuzz smoke, and doctest suites, confirming parity fixtures and CLI surfaces remain stable.【782147†L1-L58】【4bf70c†L1-L13】【b86c01†L1-L11】
- The Rust vs Go parity harness continues to agree on diff exit codes, wall-clock timings, and RSS across the curated corpus, reaffirming byte-for-byte output parity.【703c5b†L1-L4】【3d8e6a†L1-L4】【b678b2†L1-L4】

## Performance
- Criterion medians remain aligned with the recorded baselines for diffing, patch application, and renderer paths on the Kubernetes, GitHub issue, and large-array corpora.【F:docs/benchmarks.md†L1-L52】

## Known Limitations
- `cargo deny check` requires fetching the RustSec advisory database; the command may fail in network-restricted environments and should be retried once connectivity is restored.【a09cd2†L1-L2】
