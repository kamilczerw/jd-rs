# jd-rs v0.1.0 Release Notes (Draft)

## Highlights
- ✅ Feature parity with Go `jd` v2.2.2 across diff, patch, translate, and renderer modes.
- ✅ Comprehensive regression suite spanning unit, integration, property, fuzz, and CLI snapshot tests.
- ✅ Multi-platform CI matrix (Linux/macOS/Windows; stable & beta toolchains) with formatting, linting, doc tests, docs build, dependency auditing, coverage floors, and performance guardrails.

## Compatibility
- Command-line interface matches Go `jd` flag set, exit codes, and output encoding. Golden fixtures confirm byte-for-byte parity across JSON, YAML, and merge/set modes.
- Binary release targets are validated on Linux, macOS, and Windows for amd64 and arm64 in accordance with upstream release automation.

## Coverage & Quality Gates
- `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --fail-under-lines 80 --fail-under-regions 70 --summary-only` enforces minimum line and region coverage before merge.
- `scripts/check_bench_regressions.py` compares Criterion medians against `crates/jd-benches/baselines/criterion-ci.json`, rejecting regressions beyond 1.25×.
- `cargo deny check` validates licensing and vulnerability advisories each run.

## Benchmarks
- Criterion medians (nanoseconds) recorded in `crates/jd-benches/baselines/criterion-ci.json`:
  - Diff: kubernetes 72_077ns, github issue 20_259ns, large array 1_815_181ns.
  - Patch apply: kubernetes 548_839ns, github issue 32_362ns, large array 71_033_051ns.
  - Native render: kubernetes 35_721ns, github issue 50_669ns, large array 230_436ns.
  - JSON Patch render: kubernetes 52_467ns, github issue 18_447ns, large array 518_911ns.
- `scripts/bench_vs_go.sh` documents wall-clock comparisons between Rust and Go builds across the shared corpus.

## Licensing
- Upstream Go `jd` is distributed under the MIT License; jd-rs inherits the same license to ensure compatibility with redistribution requirements.

## Parity Statement
This release passes the cross-implementation parity harness against Go `jd` v2.2.2, matching native diff output, JSON Patch sequences, merge patch rendering, and CLI UX for the documented corpus.

## Upgrade Notes
- Regenerate fixtures and parity snapshots by running `./scripts/gen_list_diff_fixtures.go` and `./scripts/gen_render_fixtures.go` with Go 1.24+ installed.
- Refresh benchmark baselines after performance improvements by executing the Criterion suite and updating `crates/jd-benches/baselines/criterion-ci.json` in concert with an ADR.
